The Leek group guide to giving talks
--------------------

This guide is part of the series of guides that have so far covered [data sharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing), [reviewing papers](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews), and [writing R packages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages). The guide is designed primarily for students in statistics and computational biology although some of the ideas will be useful in other disciplines as well.

This guide is a synthesis of some ideas that I got from the following resources:

* Karl Broman's [How to give a scientific presentation](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/giving_talks.pdf). 
* Zach Holman's guide to talks [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/) and [his actual talks](http://zachholman.com/talks)


Why give talks?
----------------

Uh, cause you got invited?

When you are first starting out you should accept pretty much every opportunity to speak about your research you get. In approximate order of importance, the value of talks early in your career are:

1. To meet people
2. To make people excited about your ideas/software/results
3. To make people understand your ideas/software/results
4. To practice speaking

Later the reasons evolve, altough not be as much as you'd think. The main change is that 4 evolves more into "to show people you are a good speaker". 

The importance of point 1 can't be overstated. The primary reason you are giving talks is for people to get to know you. Being well regarded is absolutely not the goal of academia. However, being well known and well regarded can make a huge range of parts of your job easier. So first and foremost make sure you don't forget to talk to people before, after, and during your talk. 

Point 2 is more important than point 3. As a scientist, it is hard to accept that the primary purpose of a talk is advertising, not science. Here are reasons why entertainment is more important:

* People will legit fall asleep on you if you don't keep them awake - this is embarrassing
* People will never understand your ideas/software/results if they fell asleep and didn't hear about them
* There is __no way__ to convey any reasonably complicated scientific idea completely in an hour
* If you entertain people __they might go read your paper/use your code__ which is the best way to achieve goal 3. 

That being said, be very careful to avoid giving a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/browse). If you are giving a scientific presentation the goal is to communicate scientific ideas. So while you are entertaining, don't forget why you are entertaining. 


What should you talk about?
----------------

You should talk about a project that you have
