The Leek group guide to giving talks
--------------------

This guide is part of the series of guides that have so far covered [data sharing](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing), [reviewing papers](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews), and [writing R packages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages). The guide is designed primarily for students in statistics and computational biology although some of the ideas will be useful in other disciplines as well. 

This guide is in large part based on Karl Broman's [How to give a scientific presentation](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/giving_talks.pdf).  I hope that students in my group will use this guide when writing their talks and will do as I say not as I do. 


Why give talks?
----------------

Uh, cause you got invited?

When you are first starting out you should accept pretty much every opportunity to speak about your research you get. In approximate order of importance, the value of talks early in your career are:

1. To meet people
2. To advertise your ideas/software/results
3. To practice speaking

Later the reasons evolve, altough not be as much as you'd think. The main change is that 3 evolves more into "to show people you are a good speaker". 

The first two components can not be overstated. One of the primary reasons to go give a talk is to meet people.
